
                        Welcome to Inferno
                        ------------------

This release of Inferno is provided in BETA state for test
and evaluation only. It is not intended to represent the
finished operating environment. The demonstration 
applications provided with the release were developed to
test the system and are provided "as-is" for tutorial
use.

This README file contains important, last minute information
about the Inferno operating system BETA.2 distribution. 

Before you install Inferno, carefully read the installation
instructions in the Inferno documentation.

IMPORTANT: For license information on deploying Inferno and
Limbo applications, see the license agreement published on 
the Lucent Inferno web site at:

3. INSTALLATION
===============
Installation and setup instructions are provided 
in both Adobe Acrobat Reader 2.1 PDF format. See 
Installation.pdf and Environment.pdf.


4. REBUILDING DEMO APPLICATIONS
===============================

Rebuilding the Dis programs distributed with the BETA.2 version of
Inferno under Windows requires the nmake.exe program that is supplied
with Visual C++ version 4.0.

Each tar archive of platform-dependent binaries includes a mkconfig
file that is installed in the root of the Inferno tree.  The purpose of the file
is to parameterize the "mk" or "nmake" command used to build the
distribution programs. The platform-dependent parameters in the file
are:

   OBJTYPE  The object machine architecture: 386, mips, sparc, ...

   SYSHOST  The host system type: Inferno, Irix, Nt, Solaris, ...

   SYSTARG  The target system type: Inferno, Irix, Nt, Solaris, ...

To rebuild the distributed Limbo programs, first ensure that the Limbo
compiler is found in the PATH, and issue the build command from the
appropriate <inferno_root>/appl subdirectory of the Inferno tree.  That
is, issue the commands

   PATH=<inferno_root>/$SYSHOST/$OBJTYPE/bin:$PATH
   cd <inferno_root>/appl
   mk install

under Unix and

   PATH=<inferno_root>\Nt\386\bin;%PATH%
   cd <inferno_root>\appl
   nmake install

under Windows.

Note, however, that it if more than one architecture type is installed in
a single Inferno tree, the mkconfig file in the root of the tree will be
the one appropriate to the last installed distribution.  This means that
the mkconfig platform-dependent parameters may be inappropriate
for the platform where you want to run the mk or nmake command.  

If this is the case, you can override the mkconfig parameters on the 
command line.  For example, if mkconfig is for a Solaris/sparc system,
and you want to run mk to rebuild Limbo applications on an Irix/mips
system, issue the command

   mk install SYSHOST=Irix 



5. SUPPLEMENTAL DOCUMENTATION
=============================
The following documentation provides additional information
useful in the operation of this product.

6. RELEASE NOTES
================

You should not  install  to the same directory that contains Setup.exe.
----------------

The JIT compiler does not schedule threads in the same way as the
interpreter. In particular, instruction quanta can be 
unpredictably larger when generated by the JIT compiler.
----------------

Module-specific compilation does not work properly. To work 
around this problem, use the -c1 option to compile all modules or
do not run any JIT-compiling modules.
----------------

The performance of the Limbo built-in string type is poor. A new
implementation is under test.
----------------

The DES interface has been replaced with 40-bit RC4 in this
distribution to comply with US government export restrictions.
The DES interface is part of the commercial US distribution.
----------------

Module signing has been disabled in this release, but is part of
the commercial US product.
----------------

When running X-terminal packages under Windows, you must set the
color palette to 256 colors.  Use:

	Control Panel>>Display>>Settings:Color palette
----------------

Rules for entering network addresses are inconsistent. In general
addresses are entered as tcp!<machine_name>. When using the
getauthinfo program and in the remote directory dialog box (which
calls getauthinfo), enter <machine_name> only or the program will
fail.
----------------

The POP mail application in mux has been disabled. Do NOT try to 
run this program. The register and audio control applications
have been disabled as well.
----------------

To start the mux application, you must issue the
following commands (error in manual):

   bind -a '#C' /
   mux/mux

----------------

Running the Inferno Web Browser:
	When you invoke the Inferno Web Browser via Inferno's Window
	Manager, the NT or Windows 95 PATH variable will be used to 
  	 locate the Web executable. Your PATH should include the directory 
  	 where the Inferno executables are installed, that is,

     	 <inferno_root>\Nt\386\bin.  

----------------
Uninstall:
	It is recommended that you delete an Inferno instance via the
	Uninstall program found in the Inferno folder.  Uninstall will
	delete the Inferno files and registry keys that were added 
	by the installation.  The registry keys are used by Setup to
	detect a previous instance of Inferno.

	Inferno Setup adds the following keys to your registry:
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE]\SOFTWARE\Lucent Technologies\Inferno\Beta 1.0
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE]\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\App Paths\emu.exe
	[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE]\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Uninstall\InfernoDeinstKey

----------------
Services File:
	Inferno requires a number of entries to be added to your
	system Services file.  Setup will fail to do this when 
	the user does not have Read/Write permissions on the Services
	file.  This typically occurs on NT installations where the
	user does not have Administrator privileges, in such cases
	you will need to have your system administrator update the
	services file.   The file <inferno_root>\services.txt contains
	the service entries to be added.

----------------

NTFS Installation:
	When installing Inferno on an NTFS partition, it is recommended
	the user have full control over either the Inferno target directory,
	if it exists prior to Setup, or the parent directory, otherwise.
	For example, when installing to \users\inferno, the user should have
	full control over \users\inferno (if \users\inferno exists)
	or \users otherwise.
