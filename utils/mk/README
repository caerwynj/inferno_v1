Using the delivered mk to rebuild mk.

Mk will compile and run under Solaris and Irix, after you have built
Inferno you can rebuild mk. Do the following. Check the mkconfig
file that was modified when you built inferno, its values should be
correct.  Set the following in your environment

for Solaris:
	OBJTYPE=sparc export OBJTYPE
	SYSHOST=Solaris export SYSHOST
	SYSTARG=Solaris export SYSTARG

for Irix:
	OBJTYPE=mips export OBJTYPE
	SYSHOST=Irix export SYSHOST
	SYSTARG=Irix export SYSTARG

Do the following (assuming you are in the mk directory):
	cd ../libregexp
	../$SYSHOST/$OBJTYPE/bin/mk
	../$SYSHOST/$OBJTYPE/bin/mk nuke
	cd ../mk
	../$SYSHOST/$OBJTYPE/bin/mk
	mv o.out mk
	./mk nuke
