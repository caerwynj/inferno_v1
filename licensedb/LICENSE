LIMITED USE SOFTWARE LICENSE AGREEMENT FOR INFERNO BETA SOFTWARE

The terms and conditions of this  Agreement  will  apply  to  the
SOFTWARE  delivered  by  electronic  download  or other means and
derivatives obtained therefrom, including  any  copy.   The  term
SOFTWARE  includes  programs  and  related documentation supplied
herewith and updates subsequently provided by LUCENT.

If you have executed a separate Software Agreement  covering  the
Software supplied herewith, such Software Agreement will govern.

1.      TITLE AND LICENSE GRANT

     The SOFTWARE  is  copyrighted  and/or  contains  proprietary
     information  protected by law.  All SOFTWARE, and all copies
     thereof, are and will remain the sole property of LUCENT  or
     its  suppliers.  LUCENT  hereby  grants you a personal, non-
     transferable and non-exclusive right to use the SOFTWARE for
     internal  evaluation  purposes,  in whatever  form recorded,
     which is  furnished to  you under this  Agreement. Any other
     use  of this  SOFTWARE or  removal of the  SOFTWARE  from  a
     country  in  which  use  is  licensed  shall   automatically
     terminate  this  license.  No right is granted  to  use  the
     SOFTWARE  in  any   product  which  is   marketed   or  used
     commercially

     Use of SOFTWARE anywhere except in the country in which  the
     SOFTWARE  is  provided  may,  in  addition  to the terms and
     conditions of this License  Agreement,  be  subject  to  the
     terms  and conditions of a separate written agreement signed
     by the user. You acknowledge that the SOFTWARE is subject to
     U.S.  export  laws  and  regulations and any use or transfer
     must be authorized under those regulations. You  agree  that
     you  will  not  use,  distribute,  transfer, or transmit the
     SOFTWARE, or technical  information  (even  if  incorporated
     into  other  products) except in compliance with U.S. export
     regulations.

     You agree to use your best efforts to see that any  user  of
     the  SOFTWARE licensed hereunder complies with the terms and
     conditions of this License Agreement  and  to  refrain  from
     taking  any  steps,  such  as  reverse  engineering, reverse
     assembly or reverse compilation, to  derive  a  source  code
     equivalent  of  the SOFTWARE.  If the SOFTWARE is located in
     the European Community and you assert that you have a  right
     to  and  need  for  information "indispensable for achieving
     interoperability  of  an  independently   created   computer
     program"  with  the SOFTWARE, you shall submit a request for
     such information to LUCENT prior to undertaking any steps to
     reverse  engineer,  reverse  assemble or reverse compile the
     SOFTWARE.   The  meaning  of  "indispensable  for  achieving
     interoperability"  shall  be interpreted pursuant to Article
     VI of the European  Community  Computer  Software  Directive
     91/205.   If  the  information  is  deemed  indispensable by
     LUCENT, LUCENT will (a) provide such  information  within  a
     reasonable  period  of  time  or (b) advise you that you may
     decompile  the  SOFTWARE   pursuant   to   guidelines.    If
     information  is  provided under option (a) above, you may be
     charged a fee.



2.      SOFTWARE USE

   A.      You are permitted  to  make  a  single  archive  copy,
     provided  the  SOFTWARE  shall  not otherwise be reproduced,
     copied, or,  except  for  the  documentation,  disclosed  to
     others  in  whole  or  in part except as explicitly provided
     herein.  If  you  install  the  software  on a client-server
     system, you may  install the software  on a server and up to
     ten subtended clients.  Any such copy shall contain the same
     copyright notice and proprietary marking, including diskette
     markings, appearing on the original SOFTWARE.

   B.      The SOFTWARE,

       1.              together with any  archive  copy  thereof,
     shall  be  destroyed  when no longer used in accordance with
     this License  Agreement,  or  when  the  right  to  use  the
     SOFTWARE is terminated; and
       2.              shall not be removed  from  a  country  in
     which use is licensed.

   C.      You understand and  acknowledge  that  the  nature  of
     SOFTWARE  is such that in its normal operation it may access
     and download elements of  software or  data  from  resources
     which  are  external  to  the computer or device running the
     SOFTWARE, such as Inferno enabled servers. LUCENT  does  not
     undertake  to provide such external resources or servers and
     specifically disclaims any representation or warranty as  to
     the  availability,  quality or performance of such resources
     or whether they may contain any  defects  which  may  affect
     performance of the SOFTWARE or Licensee's  computer.  LUCENT
     shall not be responsible for provision of any communications
     facilities  or  the  costs  associated  with communications.
     Licensee understands  and  acknowledges  that  the  Software
     Products  may contain expiration routines which will disable
     the Software Products at the  expiration  of  this  Software
     License.


3.      NO WARRANTY


   A.      You understand and acknowledge that the SOFTWARE is  a
     "Beta"  version of a product still under development and may
     contain errors, "bugs" or other defects.   The  SOFTWARE  is
     provided  on  an  AS-IS basis, without warranty of any kind.
     Specifically, LUCENT does not warrant that the functions  of
     the  SOFTWARE  will  meet your requirements or that SOFTWARE
     operation will be error-free or uninterrupted.

   B.      LUCENT has used reasonable efforts to minimize defects
     or  errors  in the SOFTWARE. HOWEVER, YOU ASSUME THE RISK OF
     ANY AND ALL DAMAGE OR LOSS FROM USE, OR INABILITY TO USE 
     THE SOFTWARE.

   C.      Unless a separate agreement for  software  maintenance
     is  entered  into  between  you  and LUCENT, LUCENT bears no
     responsibility for supplying assistance for  fixing  or  for
     communicating known errors to you pertaining to the SOFTWARE
     supplied hereunder.

   D.      LUCENT, ITS  AFFILIATES,  CONTRACTORS,  SUPPLIERS  AND
     AGENTS   MAKE   NO   WARRANTIES,  EXPRESS  OR  IMPLIED,  AND
     SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY  WARRANTY  OF  MERCHANTABILITY 
     OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR ANY WARRANTY OF 
     INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY NONINFRINGEMENT.

     Some  states  or  other  jurisdictions  do  not  allow   the
     exclusion  of  implied warranties or limitations on how long
     an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may  not
     apply to you.  This warranty gives you specific legal rights
     and you may also have other rights which vary from one state
     or jurisdiction to another.


4.      FEEDBACK


     If you provide LUCENT with reports of bugs or errors in  the
     SOFTWARE,  reports  on  the operation of the SOFTWARE or any
     changes or modifications proposed or suggested by you to the
     Software  Products  during  the  term  of  this Agreement in
     connection  with  the   evaluating   and   testing   thereof
     ("Feedback"),   LUCENT shall have all the rights to use such
     Feedback at its discretion including, but not limited to the
     incorporation  of  such  suggested  changes or modifications
     into LUCENT software and the right to assign, license or  to
     otherwise  transfer to third parties the software so changed
     or modified without  obligation  or  recourse  to  you.  You
     hereby  grant  and  assign  to  LUCENT and its licensees all
     rights and licenses as are necessary to incorporate Feedback
     into  the  Inferno Software and/or other Lucent products and
     to distribute and otherwise commercially exploit the Inferno
     Software  and/or  other  Lucent  products without payment or
     accounting to you.

   A.     YOU AGREE THAT  YOUR SOLE  REMEDY AGAINST  LUCENT,  ITS
     AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS,  SUPPLIERS,  AND AGENTS FOR LOSS OR
     DAMAGE  CAUSED  BY  ANY DEFECT  OR FAILURE  IN THE  SOFTWARE
     REGARDLESS OF  THE FORM  OF  ACTION,  WHETHER  IN  CONTRACT,
     TORT, INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY  OR  OTHERWISE,

     EXCLUSIVE  OF  ALL  OTHER   REMEDIES  AGAINST   LUCENT,  ITS
     AFFILIATES, CONTRACTORS,  SUPPLIERS  OR  AGENTS, EXCEPT  FOR
     YOUR RIGHT TO CLAIM DAMAGES FOR BODILY INJURY TO ANY PERSON.

   B.      Regardless of any other provisions of this  Agreement,
     neither LUCENT nor its affiliates, contractors, suppliers or
     agents shall be liable  for  any  indirect,  incidental,  or
     consequential  damages (including lost profits) sustained or
     incurred in connection with the use, operation, or inability
     to  use the SOFTWARE or for damages due to causes beyond the
     reasonable control of LUCENT, its  affiliates,  contractors,
     suppliers  and  agents attributable to any service, products
     or action of any other person.

6.      MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS



   A.      This Agreement shall be construed in  accordance  with
     and governed by the laws of the State of New York, excluding

     on  behalf  of any part of the United States Government, the
     following provisions apply:  The SOFTWARE is  deemed  to  be
     "commercial  software"  and  "commercial  computer  software
     documentation,"  respectively,  pursuant  to  DFAR   Section
